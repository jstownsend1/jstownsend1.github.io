            including an intra-organizational web resource that is in use to this day by all Newport Academy
            employees. He was responsive, thoughtful and articulate in all of his communications and was
            diligent in his duties. It is my observation that Seth possesses the intelligence, ambition and
            social skills to advance far in any field he embarks in."
